# joyconLib
A Java/Kotlin library to connect with Nintendo Switch controllers.

Currently supports pairing controllers, receiving button presses, and setting
controller lights and rumble.

Uses convenient RxJava streams.

A fork from [elgoupil's repo](https://github.com/elgoupil/joyconLib),
refactored with more convenient interfaces and Pro Controller support.
